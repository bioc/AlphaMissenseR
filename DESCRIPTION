Description:
    The AlphaMissense publication
    <https://www.science.org/doi/epdf/10.1126/science.adg7492>
    outlines how a variant of AlphaFold / DeepMind was used to predict
    missense variant pathogenicity. Supporting data on Zenodo
    <https://zenodo.org/record/8360242> include, for instance, 70+M
    variants across hg19 and hg38 genome builds. The 'AlphaMissense'
    package allows ready access to the data, downloading individual
    files to DuckDB databases for ready exploration and integration
    into *R* and *Bioconductor* worksflows.
